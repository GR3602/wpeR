Description: Provides tools for analyzing pedigree data of wild
    populations. While primarily designed to process outputs from the
    [COLONY]<https://www.zsl.org/about-zsl/resources/software/colony> 
    pedigree reconstruction software, it can also accommodate
    data from other sources. By linking reconstructed pedigrees with
    genetic sample metadata, wpeR produces spatial and temporal
    visualizations as well as tabular summaries that support
    interpretation of family structures and dynamics. The main goal of the
    package is to provide a solution for the analysis of
    complex wild pedigree data and to help the user to gain insights
    into genetic relationships within wild animal populations.
