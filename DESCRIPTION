Title: Streamlined Analysis of Wild Pedigree Data
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Tomaz Skrbinsek, Gregor Simcic
Maintainer: Gregor Simcic <grega0simcic@gmail.com>
Description: Provides tools for analyzing pedigree data of wild populations. 
    While primarily designed to process outputs from the 'COLONY2' pedigree 
    reconstruction software <https://www.zsl.org/science/software/colony>, 
    it can also accommodate data from other sources. By linking reconstructed 
    pedigrees with genetic sample metadata, wpeR produces spatial and temporal 
    visualizations as well as tabular summaries that facilitate interpretation 
    of family structures and dynamics. The main goal of the package is to provide
    an efficient solution for the analysis of complex wild pedigree data and to 
    help the user to gain valuable insights into genetic relationships within
    wild animal populations.
