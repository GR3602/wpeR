Description: wpeR is an R package designed to simplify the analysis of wild pedigree
    data created by COLONY2 pedigree reconstruction software. By combining COLONY2 
    output with sample metadata, wpeR creates visual and tabular representations of the
    pedigree, allowing the user to interpret the pedigree in spatial and temporal terms. The
    main goal of the package is to provide an efficient solution for the analysis of complex wild 
    pedigree data and to help the user to gain valuable insights into genetic relationships within
    wild animal populations.
