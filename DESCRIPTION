Title: Streamlined Analysis Of Wild Pedigree Data 
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Tomaz Skrbinsek, Gregor Simcic

Description: wpeR aims to streamline the analysis of wild pedigree data. The
    package is primarily designed to work with pedigree data 
    generated by COLONY2 pedigree reconstruction software. However, it can also
    accommodate pedigree data from other sources. By combining the reconstructed
    pedigree with genetic sample metadata, wpeR creates visual and tabular
    representations of the pedigree, allowing the user to interpret the pedigree
    in spatial and temporal terms. The main goal of the package is to provide an
    efficient solution for the analysis of complex wild pedigree data and to 
    help the user to gain valuable insights into genetic relationships within
    wild animal populations.
