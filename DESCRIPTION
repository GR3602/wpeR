Title: Streamlined Analysis Of Wild Pedigree Data
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Tomaz Skrbinsek, Gregor Simcic
Maintainer: Gregor Simcic <grega0simcic@gmail.com>
Description: wpeR aims to streamline the analysis of wild pedigree data.
    The package is primarily designed to work with pedigree data generated
    by COLONY2 pedigree reconstruction software. However, it can also
    accommodate pedigree data from other sources. By combining the
    reconstructed pedigree with genetic sample metadata, wpeR creates
    visual and tabular representations of the pedigree, allowing the user
    to interpret the pedigree in spatial and temporal terms. The main goal
    of the package is to provide an efficient solution for the analysis of
    complex wild pedigree data and to help the user to gain valuable
    insights into genetic relationships within wild animal populations.
