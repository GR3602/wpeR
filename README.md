## Introduction

**w**ild **p**edigree **e**xplore**R** is an R package designed to
simplify the analysis of wild pedigree data. The package was primarily
developed to work with pedigree data generated by COLONY2 pedigree
reconstruction software. However, it can also accommodate pedigree data
from other sources. By combining the reconstructed pedigree with genetic
sample metadata, wpeR creates visual and tabular representations of the
pedigree, allowing the user to interpret the pedigree in spatial and
temporal terms. The main goal of the package is to provide an efficient
solution for the analysis of complex wild pedigree data and to help the
user to gain valuable insights into genetic relationships within wild
animal populations.
